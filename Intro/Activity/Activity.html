        <p>Lock me up and throw away the key <br>
            He knows how to get the best out of me <br>
            I'm no force for the world to see <br>
            Trade my whole life just to be</p>
        <p>Tell nobody I control you <br>
            I broke you just to own you <br>
            They can't tell that I love you <br>
            'Cause you're loyal, baby</p>
        <p>I love when you're submissive <br>
            Love it when I break skin <br>
            You feel pain without flinchin' <br>
            So say it</p>
        <p>Give me tough love <br>
            Leave me with nothin' when I come down <br>
            My kinda love <br>
            Push me and choke me 'til I pass out</p>
        <p>We don't gotta be in love, no <br>
            I don't gotta be the one, no <br>
            I just wanna be one of your girls <br>
            Tonight (tonight)</p>
        <p>We don't gotta be in love, no <br>
            I don't gotta be the one, no <br>
            I just wanna be one of your girls <br>
            Tonight (tonight), oh</p>
        <p>Push me down, hold me down <br>
            Spit in my mouth while you turn me on <br>
            I wanna take your light inside <br>
            Dim me down, snuff me out <br>
            Hands on my neck while you push it out <br>
            And I'm screamin' out</p>
        <p>Give me tough love <br>
            Leave me with nothin' when I come down <br>
            My kinda love <br>
            Force me and choke me 'til I pass out</p>
        <p>We don't gotta be in love, no <br>
            I don't gotta be the one, no <br>
            I just wanna be one of your girls <br>

            I'm no force for the world to see <br>
            Trade my whole life just to be</p>
        <p>Top of the world but I'm still not free <br>
            It's such a secret that I keep <br>
            Until it's gone, I can never find peace <br>
            Brace my whole life just to be</p>
        <p>We don't gotta be in love, no <br>
            I don't gotta be the one, no <br>
            I just wanna be one of your girls <br>
            Tonight (tonight)</p>
