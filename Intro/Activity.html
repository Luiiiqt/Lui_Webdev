        <p>Lock me up and throw away the key
            He knows how to get the best out of me
            I'm no force for the world to see
            Trade my whole life just to be</p>
        <p>Tell nobody I control you
            I broke you just to own you
            They can't tell that I love you
            'Cause you're loyal, baby</p>
        <p>I love when you're submissive
            Love it when I break skin
            You feel pain without flinchin'
            So say it</p>
        <p>Give me tough love
            Leave me with nothin' when I come down
            My kinda love
            Push me and choke me 'til I pass out</p>
        <p>We don't gotta be in love, no
            I don't gotta be the one, no
            I just wanna be one of your girls
            Tonight (tonight)</p>
        <p>We don't gotta be in love, no
            I don't gotta be the one, no
            I just wanna be one of your girls
            Tonight (tonight), oh</p>
        <p>Push me down, hold me down
            Spit in my mouth while you turn me on
            I wanna take your light inside
            Dim me down, snuff me out
            Hands on my neck while you push it out
            And I'm screamin' out</p>
        <p>Give me tough love
            Leave me with nothin' when I come down
            My kinda love
            Force me and choke me 'til I pass out</p>
        <p>We don't gotta be in love, no
            I don't gotta be the one, no
            I just wanna be one of your girls
            Tonight (tonight)</p>
        <p>We don't gotta be in love, no
            I don't gotta be the one, no (oh)
            I just wanna be one of your girls

            I'm no force for the world to see
            Trade my whole life just to be</p>
        <p>Top of the world but I'm still not free
            It's such a secret that I keep
            Until it's gone, I can never find peace
            Brace my whole life just to be</p>
        <p>We don't gotta be in love, no
            I don't gotta be the one, no
            I just wanna be one of your girls
            Tonight (tonight)</p>
        <p>We don't gotta be in love, no
            I don't gotta be the one, no (oh)
            I just wann–∞ be one of your girls
            Tonight (ooh), oh</p>
